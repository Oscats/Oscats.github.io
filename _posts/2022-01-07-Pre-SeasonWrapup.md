## Pre-Season Wrapup

We worked on quite a few goals in December. 

## Organization 
We wanted to create one downsized super-pit that would be small enough to bring to an event and fit in our closet, but big enough to leave robots and parts on mid- assembly

We also wanted to create organizational structures for our closet.

## Programming
-Get the benchtop test working with the roborio 2
-Get the new Rev control system working if there is time
-Get Ps4 controllers working.

Here is where we ended up...

- Introduced two PS4 controllers to our copiously large collection
