# Welcome to our Little Corner of the Internet

Welcome to The Oscatsâ€™ Open Alliance Build Blog. The Oscats are a small team from Hillsboro, NH. OUr motto is everyone is welcome, and everyone has something to offer. We are excited to join the Open Alliance this year as most of what we know about building robots, we learned from veteran teams, mentors, message boards, and events. We are excited to be able to give back.

We curently have about 7 members, and our dedicated space is a closet in our cafeteria. We have some incredible generous sponsors who have provided us funding to help make and buy a mobile pit setup.

A big portion of the off-season, we spent trying to make use of our space. We build and practice in the Cafeteria and classrooms. Everything must be stowed each night. We have traditionally been a Python team, but we saw the extended off-season due to COVID as an excellent opportunity to learn Java. We are currently planning on using Java this upcoming season.

We will post our updates weekly on this blog as well as on our Chief Delphi Thread.
